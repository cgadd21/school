    <article>This attraction is very unique. A team goes through several options for the design of a virtual vehicle. These changes the performance of the vehicle. This design then gets tested on a track! I went to this with my family, so I ended up in a group with them. They made some interesting decisions about the design choice. Looks are more than performance.</article>
