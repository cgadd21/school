    <article>When the sun sets guests experience EPCOT Forever. This event celebrates the past, present, and future. Fun fact, when I was working in sales at Apple, I would show customers this event on my phone. This showcases how well the camera was able to capture nightlife. After showing, it was an easy sell. Worked every time.</article>

        <h3>Fireworks</h3>
        <p>This show features fireworks and special effects. This was taken in "China". Each section in EPOCOT is based on a Country. Fun fact, China invented fireworks. Ironic isn't it.</p>

        <h3>Lights</h3>
        <p>The park lights up to give another view of the attractions. I originally thought the pyramid was the Bass Pro Shops at the Pyramid.</p>

        <h3>Ball</h3>
        <p>The giant EPCOT ball drowns in color as the night begins. During the day, it looks like a giant golf ball. Inside this massive structure is the Spaceship Earth attraction.</p>
