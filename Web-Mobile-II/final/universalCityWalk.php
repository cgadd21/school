    <article>The city walk is where a majority of the shops and restaurants are. One of the most unique restaurants is Cow Fish. You can assume what they serve. There's an outside second-floor seating area in this establishment. During sunset, it was enjoyable to eat and see the sunset on the skyline.</article>
