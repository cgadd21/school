    <article>This hotel features a 9-hole golf course on the property. It has green grass and blue ponds. Many creatures find themselves enjoying the course. Rumour has it that an alligator likes to hang out on the third hole. The fun part was getting paired up with another duo each time you play. Met a lot of interesting folks from this.</article>
