    <article>EPCOT is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida. It is close enough to Orlando so it's on this website. Since 1982 EPCOT has been available to the public. It showcases human achievement, technological innovation, and international culture. This park has more displays that are pleasant to the eye. Which is different from the thrills rollercoasters provide at other Disney parks.</article>
