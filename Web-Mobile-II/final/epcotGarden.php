        <article>The gardens in EPCOT are one of the most creative gardens I've laid my eyes on. These gardens feature classic and new Disney characters for thousands to view. They compliment the park to ensure that guests have a fantastic time. My personal favorite was the pandas.</article>

            <h3>Kermit</h3>
            <p>This is Kermit. He is from the Muppets. I never watched the show, but I listen to their version of Twelve Days of Christmas.</p>
