		<p><strong>Between 2015 and 2016 she was the Resident Coordinator and Representative of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Namibia.</strong> In 2018 Gbeho became Deputy Joint Special Envoy for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), taking over from Bintou Keita. In that year her ultimate boss United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres noted that there had been no measurable political improvement in Darfur.</p>

		<p><strong>Her past experience includes assignments at UN Headquarters in New York, as well as in conflict and post-conflict environments such as Angola, Cambodia, Iraq, Namibia, and Sudan.</strong> She also has previous experience with Somalia through her work with the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) from 2007 – 2012. Somalia’s security situation can unfortunately impose limitations on the ability of UN officials to freely move about.  However, when an opportunity to get up from behind a desk or from a conference room arises, they seize it. Interacting with different parts of society helps them get a better understanding of the people they serve.</p>

		<p><strong>Gbeho is part of the leadership team in Somalia working under James Swan, who was the target of an assassination attempt that killed others in 2019.</strong> She spends some of her time travelling to different areas in Somalia to understand their needs, although security limits her freedom. During a visit to Kismayo, the interim capital of Jubaland, in November 2021, she was given a security briefing at the airport before heading for the UN compound. She met Jubaland President, Ahmed Mohamed Islam ‘Madobe’, and was "very pleased" to hear that two seats were to be reserved for women in Somalia's upper house by the President. This is in line with the objective of getting 30% of the country's political representation to be by women.</p>

		<p><strong>In January 2022 Gbeho attended the Africa Union (AU) and Federal Government of Somalia's Technical meeting in Mogadishu with international representatives including Tiina Intelmann of the EU and Kate Foster of the UK.</strong></p>
