            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>I’ve lived most of my life in Western New York. My education journey has taken me through Attica High School, Genesee Community College, Erie Community College, Monroe Community College, and <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>. I’ve learned many programming languages, along with other skills while attending these institutes. During my time at RIT, I have involved myself in many extracurricular activities.  My life has been enriched with experiences that have furthered my life in ways that I cannot explain. My life is always busy, with a second never wasted. In return I’ve been able to fill my <em>brain</em> with new information.</p>

                <h3>Scholar</h3>

                <p>I graduated from Attica High School in 2022. From there I continued my education at Monroe Community College for a couple years. I ended my journey there with an Associates of Science in Information Technology in 2022. I transferred to Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computing and Information Technology</strong>. I’ll graduate in 2024. Throughout my years I’ve learned many programming languages. This includes Java, Python, C, C#, C++, Linux, Bash, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. I also have the knowledge on databases and networking. School activities are a portion of my life. These include RIT Chess Club, RIT Golf Club, RITSEC, Society of Software Engineers, and Google Developer Student Club at RIT.</p>

                <h3>Experiences</h3>

                <p>My entire life has been new experiences. Recently, I took a trip to Orlando, Florida. I stayed at a resort that featured a golf course around the entire resort property. The worst part was almost driving the golf carts near Florida drivers. I’ve also been up to Quebec for a snowmobile trip. Ever since that trip, the cold has never bothered me. My group woke up to <em>negative forty degrees</em> early one morning. The Adirondack Mountains were fantastic for snowmobiling, tubing, and hiking. The Islands near the southern coast of the United States were very interesting as well.</p>

                <h3>Talents</h3>

                <p>In my ever-decreasing free time, I enjoy learning. Recently, my time has been spent learning <em>chess</em>. I have been able to apply the lessons from the game to my everyday life. This game has made me a better man. Opportunities have also risen since I’ve started studying the game. I’ve made connections that would’ve not been possible without it. During the summer this year, golf struck my fancy. I played every week during the summer. My game has improved dramatically because of this. Lastly, I participated in donuts whenever there’s fresh snow that’s fallen. I found this very entertaining after a snowstorm early last year. I was at a local state park that wasn’t plowed. The main purpose of that trip wasn’t to create immaculate circles with my vehicle. Skiing is always something that fascinated me. For the past few years, I’ve been perfecting my rollerblading, and ice-skating abilities. So skiing was the natural progression. As expected, I picked it up quickly, and before I knew it, I was flying down the hills.</p>
