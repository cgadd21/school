# Developing Apps for IOS

The lectures for the Spring 2023 version of Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI) were given in person but, unfortunately, were not video recorded.  However, we did capture the laptop screen of the presentations and demos as well as the associated audio.  You can watch these screen captures using the links below.  You'll also find links to supporting material that was distributed to students during the quarter (homework, demo code, etc.).

The curriculum is substantially similar to the Spring 2021 version, so if you have already watched that, you might find L14 to be the most interesting (actor-based async programming).  Note also that WWDC 2023 has come and gone and the change introduced there that probably affects the curriculum below the most is the update made to the reactive UI mechanism in SwiftUI (@Observable versus ObservableObject).  Presumably ObservableObject will be backwards-compatible for a while, but starting with Xcode 15/iOS 17, you'll likely want to move to using @Observable.
